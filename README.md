## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- Media query

### What I learned

Ok! I learned alot during this challenge.
I used CSS Grid only for making layouts and a lot of media query to make something presentable.

### Continued development

To be honest for these kind of layouts pepole need more than just mobile design and desktop design.
By the way i need more practice with CSS Grid responsive layouts.
